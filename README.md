# Pocket Sammy

Pocket Sammy is URL bookmarking app that was inspired by DO's hackathon where contestants need to submit simple CRUD App that is running on MongoDB.

Since using DOs services Sammy has always been there.. silently in background doing all the tasks that user requests. Since I always saw Sammy as a background task ninja, It didn't take long to realize that he has to be recognized! In a way I guess I wanted to say "Thank you!" to Sammy for all this time he has been working silently in background. But what CRUD App should I make? ðŸ¤”

TODO App? User management? Blog? Meh.. we've all been through countless TODO app tutorials and CRUD Apps. And then it clicked. Since I've always been crazy with bookmarking and pocketing URLs for later use I thought, why not create Pocket CRUD App? Pocket Sammy!? ðŸ¤¯ That's it!
